# Examples

These examples assume that the build products (the `viz.js` file, etc.) are available in the lib/ directory.

## Script tag

The simplest way to use Viz.js in a webpage.

## Parcel

One way to use Viz.js with the <a href="https://parceljs.org">Parcel</a> bundler. This example uses a dynamic import to avoid including the `viz.js` file in the main bundle.

## Tester

Demonstrates all of the Viz.js API, including getters for the list of supported layout engines and output formats and  structured error messages from `render()`.
